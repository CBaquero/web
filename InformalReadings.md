# Informal Readings @Porto

In **Informal Readings** we meet on a monthly basis to discuss interesting papers and new results of interest to distributed systems research. We gather a small group of researchers from University of Porto, as well as graduate students and guests from other institutions.

For each session a paper is chossen by a prospective _Reader _and communicated in advance. During the session the _Reader_ describes the paper (possibly, but not necessarily, using slides) in order to start a brief discussion on the topic. Sessions will be limited to one hour.
